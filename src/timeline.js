      <div class="question">Where did you see your first GIF?</div>
      I didn't make any note about it 22 years ago, but it easily could be one of Steve Kangas' creations.
      Maybe <a href="http://209.197.100.244/mmmm/new437/welcomer.gif">"Welcome to the Internet?"</a>
      or <a href="http://209.197.100.244/mmmm/new926/tvfun.gif">"The web is more fun!"</a>.
      Maybe something else, somewhere else. Not important. More important is that Kangas’ 1995 animated GIFs collection
      <a href="http://209.197.100.244/mmmm/">is still online</a> and anyone can go there and feel like early web adopter.

      <div class="question">When did you make your first GIF?</div>
      1996. <a href="http://www.teleportacia.org/war/wind.gif">It’s this one</a>.

      <div class="question">What about the format initially appealed to you as a method for practice?</div>
      I needed some motion for the scenery for my piece “<i><a href="http://www.teleportacia.org/war/">My boyfriend came back from the war</a></i>.” (1996) Animated GIF was the only option at that time.

      <div class="question">Do you think GIFs have changed since you began working with them? If so, how?</div>
      GIFs have changed a lot, and many many times. The biggest change, though, is that it is not seen as a building element for a web page anymore. People rarely make GIFs that would become part of a web page or many webpages. GIFs are made to be posted. That's sad.

      <div class="question">What is your favorite GIF you have made?</div>
      In 2005, I became an animated GIF model. Three perfect movements of mine were offered to web users to implement in their web pages: Dancing, hula-hooping, and playing accordion. I sent the GIFs to free GIF collections, and later found that my image was implemented into many people’s web pages. GIFs were born to be part of a page, so I tried to be as distributed as possible.
      This piece, <a href="http://bukk.it/olia/summer/"><i>Summer (2013)</i></a>, works only if 25 of my friends’ servers are up and running. I am happy and proud it still works!

      <a href="http://best.effort.network/">This is my favorite GIF</a>.
      I wanted a GIF that is unpredictable, so I created a set of instructions that animate on fly. In fact it is not truly a GIF, but an animated PNG.
      <a href="http://best.effort.network/packets.png">But that is a secret</a> :)

      <div class="question">What is your favorite GIF someone else has made?</div>
      <a href="http://contemporary-home-computing.org/vernacular-web-2/hulagirl.gif">Dancing Girl, by Chuck Poynter, 1996</a>.
      She is my inspiration, and one of the central figures in my
      <a href="http://blog.geocities.institute/archives/5675">Digital Folklore research</a>.

      <div class="question">In your opinion, what's next for the GIF, both in and out of art practice?</div>
      I hope the format will stay prominent. I hope it will not dissolve in the ocean of video streams and dynamic apps. I wish the thousands of GIF and transparent stamp-makers of blingee.com will not lose their base, and lurkers such as myself can continue to "surf” through stamp to blingee to stamp to blingee, admiring their skills.

      I count on such artists as Lona Mills, Sofya Glebovna, and Gretchen Andrew. They can see that transparency is more important than a loop. For them, the GIF is not a tool, but a medium It is central in their productions. Precious!

      <div class="question">Where did you see your first GIF?</div>
      It would have been the Fall of 1996, at Oberlin College (where I am currently teaching as a full-time visiting Media Art Faculty, and my students love GIFs!) I got my first computer, got access to a T1 connection, and started surfing immediately. I’m guessing the first GIF I ever saw was probably
      <a href="http://valhallawebdesign.com/images/torch2.gif">this one</a>.

      <div class="question">When did you make your first GIF? Do you remember what it was?</div>
      I made my first GIF that same semester: freshman year of college, 1996. It would have either been for an Intro to New Media Art course or an Intro to Web Design course. In a later semester, I remember making a pixel-perfect GIF of a sad loner pushing a shopping cart for a PHP scripting assignment. It was most definitely a rip-off in style of
      <a href="http://hello.eboy.com/eboy/">this project</a>,
      which was a big game-changer for me and my friends, here at Oberlin (this is what we referred to at the time as the “pixel-perfect” style of the time)

      <div class="question">What about the format initially appealed to you as a method for practice and why do you think the GIF has endured as a  medium for artists?</div>
      This was a new form of digital animation shared amongst users: we embraced the form and ran with it, engineering an entire new folk art vocabulary within a very short period of time. “Digital Folklore” as Olia Lialina might call it.
      It has endured because it is so quick to digest. It’s more eye-catching than just an image but doesn’t take any time to “get” usually, because the loops are so short. Also, it’s more net-specific than just a still image or a moving video. It references digitally networked culture in a way that still images and video do not (but of course, can.)

      <div class="question">Do you think GIFs have changed since you began working with them? If so, how?</div>
      YES—they change every time a new person learns how to make one. Networked Digital Culture is so vast, moves so fast and is so ephemeral, it is impossible to chart its histories in any accurate way. But we do have the myths we like to tell ourselves. One of those myths is that at first GIFs were created by naive non-professionals (‘amateurs’ is the problematic term I used above to describe what could have been the “first wave” or people making GIFs). At a certain point, artists and other “creative pranksters” began to make “self-aware” GIFs, that were aware of their own goofy nature and/or their technological limitations. However, this is a great over-simplification and labeling certain GIFs as “self-aware” while others are labeled “naive” seems rude to me.

      <div class="question">In your opinion, what's next for the GIF, both in and out of art practice?</div>
      As I was trying to explain above: it is impossible to comprehend Networked Digital Culture’s progress in any accurate way, because it is always changing. But I suppose within that ever-changing landscape, history is cyclical. In addition, it seems that people on the Internet especially love to make fun of things and to quickly see how far they can take any and every joke until it feels “culturally dead.” Then they leave the joke behind or return to it a little bit later after it has sufficiently rotted and turned into a cool enough looking zombie to investigate again.

    <div class="question">Where did you see your first GIF?</div>
    On AOL somewhere. . .Or maybe Angelfire <i>[Ed note: Angelfire was a competitor of Geocities]</i>. I feel like it was an animated emoticon. I had seen so many still emoticons and i was really excited when i found out that it was possible for them to become animated. It brought so much life to the screen.

    <div class="question">When did you make your first GIF?</div>
    Probably 2003 or 2004. Something for my livejournal, I think. Lol.

    <div class="question">What about the format initially appealed to you as a method for practice?</div>
    The simplicity of making something move by manipulating it frame by frame. It was so simple and stupid that the possibilities felt endless.

    <div class="question">Do you think GIFs have changed since you began working with them? If so, how?</div>
    Sure, I think they become more elegant. People wanted the web to move away from choppy, pixely feel to smoother things. You would see gifs that were really smooth and photo-realistic. Personally, I like the scrappiness of the older stuff.

    <div class="question">What is your favorite GIF you have made?</div>
    I always like the series of “<a href="http://www.petracortright.com/works/selected_show/system_landscapes.html">system landscapes</a>” that I did.

    Hopefully future browsers will keep allowing the format. I would like to see a return to a internet era more reflective of “personal homepages,” or even pimping Myspace pages. Something where people were allowed to be more creative in the way they presented themselves online. I don’t know if that will happen, though.

    <div class="question">Where did you see your first GIF?</div>
    Not a GIF exactly, but the first looping animation I remember was the software agent Clippy that haunted Windows XP in the 90's. The way it stood still but kept blinking was cute and kind of creepy at the same time.

    <div class="question">When did you make your first GIF? Do you remember what it was?</div>
    I think it was 2009 while I was still studying at architecture school. It was a GIF showing the mechanism of a scissor elevator unfolding on an architectural section.

    <div class="question">What about the format initially appealed to you as a method for practice, and why do you think the GIF has endured as a medium for artists? </div>
    The most tempting and almost magical thing about GIFs is the fact that they contain motion and temporal characteristics within a format that is so easy to use, create, and disseminate. It demands that we find a way to fit meaningful content into a few looping seconds. I find it almost mesmerizing, and is perceived by viewers as super dynamic and almost mesmerizing. When I look at GIFs sometimes, I consider them to be short digital gestures. There is something quite gestural in their existence.

    <div class="question">Do you think GIFs have changed since you began working with them? If so, how?</div>
    Apart from the technical side and the fact that it's now way easier to create GIFs through a multitude of mediums and apps, the way and speed at which they are dispersed has changed dramatically. GIFs don't just reflect and comment on present situations but they are almost creating trends. They are now able to produce and alter our collective perception, our everyday written word, and the way we express ourselves through content in a very peculiar and interesting way.

    <div class="question">What is your favorite GIF you have made?</div>
    It's the <a href="http://68.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcyw8e8FTI1qzo4qro1_r4_1280.gif">one</a>
    I'm using as my signature at the end of my emails. I think it's already 5 years old! It has a weird energy. I don't even remember what I was trying to create when I made it – something between a bird and an island that moves intensely, like it's trying to escape some kind of invisible trap.

    <div class="question">What is your favorite GIF someone else has made?</div>
    I would say these are the three that come straight to mind:
    This <a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/xUPGcoktj4oGLh9OIE">one</a> from Lorna Mills,
    this <a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/fire-galaxy-burn-l0MYHSJVB27EYLHOM">one</a> from Anthony Antonellis,
    and this <a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/26tPnDGUCBRswfK6c">one</a> from Faith Holland.

    <div class="question">In your opinion, what's next for the GIF, both in and out of art practice?</div>
    Despite the fact that it is already a few decades old, the GIF keeps re-inventing itself in ways that feel quite fresh. I would like to be able to more easily disperse GIFs that can be relatively small in size but high in quality. I'd like to see GIFS that can be embedded everywhere and hopefully become more complex and diverse in content; for example, GIFs that are as informative as they are entertaining. Furthermore, I believe they will continue to be the visual medium of communication that challenges the boundaries between oral speech and written word.
